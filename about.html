                        <p>Ted Lasso is an American sports comedy-drama streaming television series developed by Jason Sudeikis, Bill Lawrence, Brendan Hunt, and Joe Kelly, based on a character of the same name that Sudeikis first portrayed in a series of promos for NBC Sports' coverage of the Premier League.</p>
                            
                        <p>The series follows Ted Lasso, an American college football coach who is hired to coach an English soccer team in an attempt by its owner to spite her ex-husband. Lasso tries to win over the skeptical English market with his folksy, optimistic demeanor while dealing with his inexperience in the sport.</p>

                        <p>One of the many Ted's talents is baking. An extremely delicious bread biscuit he prepares throughout the series helps him win over the hearts and tastes!</p>
